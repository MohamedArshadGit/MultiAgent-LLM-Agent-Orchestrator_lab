      "Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents— including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more— LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework and runtime for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents. LangGraph is very low-level, and focused entirely on agent orchestration. Before using LangGraph, we recommend you familiarize yourself with some of the components used to build agents, starting with models and tools. We will commonly use LangChain components throughout the documentation to integrate models and tools, but you don’t need to use LangChain to use LangGraph. If you are just getting started with agents or want a higher-level abstraction, we recommend you use LangChain’s agents that provide pre-built architectures for common LLM and tool-calling loops. LangGraph is focused on the underlying capabilities important for agent orchestration: durable execution, streaming, human-in-the-loop, and more.\n",

If you don’t need these capabilities or would like to customize your own for your agents and autonomous applications, start with LangChain.Use LangGraph, our low-level agent orchestration framework and runtime, when you have more advanced needs that require a combination of deterministic and agentic workflows and heavy customization.\n",

       "  AIMessage(content='**LangGraph** is an open‑source library (maintained by the LangChain team) that makes it easy to build **stateful, graph‑driven applications powered by LLMs**.  \\n\\nThink of it as a thin “orchestration layer” on top of LangChain that lets you describe **complex, multi‑step workflows as directed graphs** where each node is a piece of logic (often a LangChain component) and the edges define how execution moves from one step to the next, possibly based on the current **state**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Why LangGraph?\\n\\n| Problem in traditional LLM apps | How LangGraph helps |\\n|--------------------------------|----------------------|\\n| **Linear, hard‑coded pipelines** (e.g., prompt → LLM → post‑process) become messy when you need loops, conditionals, or parallel branches. | You declaratively draw a graph: nodes → edges, and the engine handles routing. |\\n| **State management** – you have to manually pass around dictionaries, keep track of what the LLM has already done, and persist checkpoints. | LangGraph gives you a **typed `State` object** that is automatically updated and can be persisted (e.g., to a DB or checkpoint file). |\\n| **Resilience / recoverability** – if a step fails or you need to restart from a checkpoint, you often have to re‑implement that logic. | Built‑in **checkpointing and resume**: the graph can be paused, stored, and resumed from any node. |\\n| **Agent‑style loops** (e.g., “think → act → observe → think …”) require custom while‑loops and termination heuristics. | You can express loops directly in the graph with a **`while` edge** and a termination condition on the state. |\\n| **Testing & composability** – isolated unit tests for each step become tangled when the workflow is a monolithic function. | Each node is a **stand‑alone callable** (LangChain `Chain`, `Tool`, or any async function), making it trivial to unit‑test and reuse. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Core Concepts\\n\\n| Concept | What it is | Typical implementation |\\n|---------|------------|------------------------|\\n| **Node** | A unit of work – could be a LangChain `Chain`, a tool call, a custom Python function, or even an LLM prompt. | `node = RunnableLambda(fn)` or `node = MyChain()` |\\n| **Edge** | Directed connection that tells the runtime where to go next. Edges can be unconditional or **conditional** based on the current `State`. | `graph.add_edge(\"extract\", \"summarize\")` or `graph.add_conditional_edge(\"router\", condition_fn, {\"yes\":\"step_a\",\"no\":\"step_b\"})` |\\n| **State** | A mutable dictionary (or a typed Pydantic model) that travels with the execution, holding inputs, intermediate outputs, flags, counters, etc. | `state = {\"question\": \"...\", \"facts\": [], \"iterations\": 0}` |\\n| **Loop / While Edge** | Special edge that points back to a previous node while a predicate on the state is true. | `graph.add_while_edge(\"think\", \"act\", lambda s: not s[\"done\"])` |\\n| **Checkpoint** | Snapshot of the whole graph’s state (node positions + `State`) that can be persisted and later reloaded. | `graph.checkpoint()` → saved to a DB or file. |\\n| **Executor** | The runtime that walks the graph, invoking nodes, updating state, handling async, retries, and logging. | `graph.run(state)` (sync) or `await graph.arun(state)` (async) |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Minimal Example\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\\n\\n# 1️⃣ Define the state schema (optional but recommended)\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nclass MyState(BaseModel):\\n    question: str\\n    answer: str | None = None\\n    attempts: int = 0\\n    done: bool = False\\n\\n# 2️⃣ Build reusable LangChain components\\nextract_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\\n    \"Extract the core question from this user query:\\\\n{question}\"\\n)\\nextract_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(), prompt=extract_prompt)\\n\\nanswer_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\\n    \"Answer the following question concisely:\\\\n{question}\"\\n)\\nanswer_chain = LLMChain(llm=OpenAI(), prompt=answer_prompt)\\n\\n# 3️⃣ Wrap them as graph nodes\\ndef extract_node(state: MyState):\\n    resp = extract_chain.run(question=state.question)\\n    state.question = resp.strip()\\n    return state\\n\\ndef answer_node(state: MyState):\\n    resp = answer_chain.run(question=state.question)\\n    state.answer = resp.strip()\\n    state.done = True\\n    return state\\n\\n# 4️⃣ Assemble the graph\\ngraph = StateGraph(MyState)\\ngraph.add_node(\"extract\", extract_node)\\ngraph.add_node(\"answer\", answer_node)\\n\\n# Straight‑line flow: extract → answer\\ngraph.add_edge(\"extract\", \"answer\")\\ngraph.set_entry_point(\"extract\")\\n\\n# 5️⃣ Run\\ninitial_state = MyState(question=\"Hey, can you tell me how to bake a chocolate cake?\")\\nfinal_state = graph.run(initial_state)\\n\\nprint(final_state.answer)\\n```\\n\\n**What happens?**\\n\\n1. The graph starts at **`extract`**, which rewrites the raw user query into a clean question.  \\n2. The updated state is passed to **`answer`**, which produces the final response.  \\n3. Because the state is a Pydantic model, you get type safety, validation, and easy serialization for checkpointing.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Typical Use‑Cases\\n\\n| Use‑case | How LangGraph shines |\\n|----------|----------------------|\\n| **Multi‑tool agents** (e.g., “search → retrieve → summarize → decide”) | Each tool is a node; the router node decides the next step based on the retrieved data. |\\n| **Self‑ask / ReAct loops** | Loop edges let the agent keep “thinking → acting → observing” until a `done` flag is set. |\\n| **Hybrid RAG pipelines** (retrieval → LLM → post‑processing → feedback) | Graph can branch: if relevance is low, go back to retrieval; otherwise continue. |\\n| **Human‑in‑the‑loop workflows** | Insert a “human_review” node that pauses execution and waits for external input before proceeding. |\\n| **Batch / parallel processing** | Fork edges can spawn multiple sub‑graphs (e.g., summarizing several documents in parallel) and then join. |\\n| **Debuggable, auditable pipelines** | Every node transition is logged; you can replay from any checkpoint to reproduce a result. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n## How It Relates to LangChain\\n\\n| LangChain | LangGraph |\\n|-----------|-----------|\\n| Provides **chains, agents, tools, memory, retrievers** – the building blocks that actually talk to LLMs or external APIs. | Provides the **orchestration layer** that wires those blocks together in a graph, handling state, loops, and persistence. |\\n| You can use **any LangChain component** as a node in a LangGraph. | LangGraph adds **graph‑specific utilities** (conditional edges, while loops, checkpointing) that LangChain alone does not have. |\\n| Typical usage: `chain = LLMChain(...)` → `chain.run(input)` | Typical usage: `graph = StateGraph(state_schema)` → `graph.add_node(\"my_chain\", chain)` → `graph.run(state)` |\\n\\nIn practice, many projects start with a simple LangChain chain and later “upgrade” to LangGraph when the workflow grows beyond a linear sequence.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Getting Started\\n\\n1. **Install**  \\n\\n   ```bash\\n   pip install \"langgraph[all]\"   # pulls LangChain and optional extras\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Read the official tutorial** – the LangGraph docs have a “Getting Started” notebook that walks through building a ReAct agent step‑by‑step.\\n\\n3. **Explore the examples** – the repo ships with ready‑made graphs for:\\n   * ReAct / Self‑Ask agents  \\n   * Multi‑document RAG with feedback loops  \\n   * Human‑in‑the‑loop review pipelines  \\n\\n4. **Pick a state model** – start with a simple `dict` if you’re prototyping, then migrate to a Pydantic model for production (type safety + easy serialization).\\n\\n5. **Run locally, then add persistence** – LangGraph works out‑of‑the‑box with in‑memory state; you can later plug in a `SqliteCheckpointSaver` or a custom DB to store checkpoints.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## TL;DR Summary\\n\\n- **LangGraph = Graph‑based orchestration for LLM apps** built on top of LangChain.  \\n- You define **nodes** (any callable, usually a LangChain chain or tool) and **edges** (including conditional and looping edges).  \\n- A mutable **state** travels through the graph, letting each step read/write data, decide next steps, and be checkpointed.  \\n- It solves the pain points of **complex control flow, state persistence, testing, and resilience** that become cumbersome with plain LangChain pipelines.  \\n- Use it when you need anything beyond a simple linear chain: multi‑tool agents, loops, branching logic, human‑in‑the‑loop steps, or robust production‑grade pipelines.\\n\\nIf you want to dive deeper, let me know— I can fetch the latest LangGraph tutorial or specific API docs for you.', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user asks \"What is Langgraph?\" Need to answer.

       "  AIMessage(content='**LangChain** is an open‑source framework that makes it easier to build applications powered by large language models (LLMs).  \\nInstead of writing raw API calls and glue code yourself, LangChain gives you reusable building blocks and higher‑level abstractions so you can focus on the *logic* of your product.\\n\\n| **What LangChain Provides** | **Why It Matters** |\\n|-----------------------------|--------------------|\\n| **LLM wrappers** – unified interfaces for OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace, Azure, etc. | Swap models or providers with a single line change. |\\n| **Prompt templates & management** – variable substitution, few‑shot examples, chat‑history handling. | Keep prompts clean, versioned, and reusable. |\\n| **Chains** – sequential pipelines that connect prompts, LLM calls, and other utilities (e.g., parsing, post‑processing). | Encode complex reasoning steps ( “question → retrieve docs → answer” ) without boiler‑plate. |\\n| **Agents** – dynamic decision‑making loops that let an LLM choose which tool to call next (search, calculator, database, etc.). | Build truly interactive assistants that can act on the fly. |\\n| **Memory** – short‑term (conversation) or long‑term (vector store) state that is automatically fed into prompts. | Preserve context across turns or retrieve relevant facts from external knowledge bases. |\\n| **Retrieval‑Augmented Generation (RAG)** – connectors to vector stores (FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.) and document loaders (PDF, CSV, web pages). | Ground LLM outputs in up‑to‑date, domain‑specific data. |\\n| **Tooling & integrations** – callbacks for tracing, streaming, evaluation, LangSmith observability, LangServe deployment, etc. | Monitor, debug, and scale your pipelines in production. |\\n| **Ecosystem** – a growing collection of community‑contributed “components” (e.g., SQL agents, spreadsheet tools, code interpreters). | Reuse proven patterns rather than reinventing them. |\\n\\n### Typical Workflow\\n\\n1. **Load data** (documents, APIs, databases).  \\n2. **Create a vector store** (embedding model → index).  \\n3. **Define a Retrieval‑QA chain**:  \\n   - Retrieve relevant chunks →  \\n   - Build a prompt with those chunks →  \\n   - Call the LLM →  \\n   - Post‑process the answer.  \\n4. **Add memory or agents** if you need multi‑turn conversation or tool‑use.  \\n5. **Deploy** via LangServe, FastAPI, or a serverless function, and monitor with LangSmith.\\n\\n### Who Uses LangChain?\\n\\n- **Developers** building chatbots, knowledge‑base assistants, code‑generation tools, or any product that needs LLM reasoning.  \\n- **Data teams** creating RAG pipelines to answer questions over internal documents.  \\n- **Enterprises** that want a standardized, testable, and observable way to integrate LLMs into existing services.\\n\\n### Quick Example (Python)\\n\\n```python\\nfrom langchain.llms import OpenAI\\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\\nfrom langchain.chains import LLMChain\\n\\n# 1️⃣ Prompt template\\ntemplate = \"\"\"You are a helpful assistant. Answer the question below in a concise way.\\n\\nQuestion: {question}\\nAnswer:\"\"\"\\nprompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)\\n\\n# 2️⃣ LLM wrapper\\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", temperature=0.2)\\n\\n# 3️⃣ Chain (prompt → LLM)\\nqa_chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)\\n\\n# 4️⃣ Run\\nresponse = qa_chain.run({\"question\": \"What are the three laws of thermodynamics?\"})\\nprint(response)\\n```\\n\\nThe same code works with `model=\"anthropic/claude-3-haiku\"` or a self‑hosted HuggingFace model by just swapping the `OpenAI` wrapper.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**In short:** LangChain is a modular toolkit that abstracts away the repetitive plumbing of LLM‑centric applications, letting you compose prompts, retrieval, memory, and tool‑use into production‑ready pipelines with minimal code.', additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user asks \"What is Langchain?\" Provide a concise explanation.
